如果要出海打渔，最好是成为海盗，个体户  
远赴南太平洋，去悉尼吧  
用水草伪装，潜游在巨大远洋渔船之后  
有关杀戮的冒险，深海里看不见血色  
脱掉它们，走过小城闹市人群，和树荫  
爬五层楼梯，你是中年人之子  
周旋、躲藏、说谎，你必须保全自己  
为他们  

如果出发在深夜，最好是一个通宵，她疾走  
思考棺和墓的尺寸，又动身  
是熟悉的路，然而没有别的人，似乎是没有  
看见火把、人影，听得见笑声  
她往前，遇上同伴，是九岁的那一个  
旧友，也许可以这样说，天始终不能亮起来  
已无家还，路过谁的门外，睁眼，继续等  
天会亮  

也许算不上巧合，更不是什么秘密，早说过  
你们正听同样的歌，阅读相同的文章  
那作家明明写了很多文字，但它们不是巧合  
从来如此，总是如此，像梦  
本就是梦  

这几天梦中醒来的时刻，脑海中总是飘着南京市民李先生那首著名的To be with you的前两句歌词。这很怪。轮盘开始转动起来了。这很怪。又开始反复梦见同一个人了。这很怪。可是，我也的确又一次活过来了。这并不奇怪。就是死不了。🚬

“昨天在梦里 我又看见你”  
“我想和你在一起 直到我不爱你 宝贝 人和人 一场游戏”  
“宝贝 随便吧 随便吧”  
“宝贝 我也只能 这样爱你”  

很好。我依然没有很多的表达欲。但是我感觉我可以慢慢恢复自己真正想做的事了。


The most exciting part of my day was completing a 5 km outdoor run with my husband this morning. We broke our personal speed record—nearly hitting 6 minutes per kilometer. It felt amazing. I was so proud of myself, especially because there were two moments when I almost gave up, but I didn’t. I didn’t officially sign up for a race, but deep inside, I was determined to win once—for myself. Even though it was just a small training run, I believed that if I kept going as far as I could, I would be able to prove something to myself. If I could manage something a little harder than before, maybe I really could make some progress in life.

The second moment of genuine peace and joy came when we sat down for our daily coffee at Jam, a lovely local café. My husband ordered a small Long Black, and I had my usual Flat White. As I took a slow sip of coffee, I suddenly felt as if I were being loved by fate. For a brief moment, everything was still. I felt completely at peace.

I should also mention that I had a beautiful dream last night. I dreamed of him again. In the dream, we met at an event, and I noticed that he was reading the exact same passage as I was. The music he had been listening to lately was exactly what I’d been listening to, too. It wasn’t a coincidence or a secret—he and I have always shared the same taste in music and literature. We both love the same writer and the same musician. Even though we haven’t talked in a while, I sometimes feel that we might still be doing similar things in our separate lives. That dream left me feeling both quietly happy and slightly lost.
