旧手机里真的是什么好东西都有啊。

“如果要回到能说服自己的逻辑，那就是依旧相信直觉。”——是自己能说出来的话？

一病毁所有，不吃药的这两年虽然感受到很多的平静，可是智商再也回不去了。这真的是要为自己感到遗憾啊。

“飞得起来，应该飞得起来～”完完全全只能靠自己飞起来的时候到了。什么是信任和依赖？它们早已不复存在。我没什么难过的。

故意设防，可以体谅，不能原谅。

马桶，一个天然烟灰缸。

动荡不安、兵荒马乱的一夜。睡不到四小时，也无法再睡。身心俱疲。三十二，似乎和二十二也没差。把烟熄灭了，虎口依旧无法脱险。

The issue is not whether love exists, but that it has never appeared as I had hoped. There is a gap in between, one that can only be bridged by endless understanding. So just live with it, no matter what form love takes.

I have seen the face of love countless times. His love is like a cloud, changing shape, even disappearing, only to return as heavy rain and a rainbow.

Maintaining a state of defenselessness is certainly wonderful. But why keep launching atomic bombs from afar, crossing the defense lines, and shattering others' territories into pieces? What good does that do for oneself, leaving behind a naked, empty-handed self and an ammunition depot reduced to nothing? There is nothing left to protect oneself, and it seems there never was a need for protection—like an oyster gradually losing its shell, no longer fearing the loss, because it now lives in a vast, tranquil, and gentle sea.

保持不设防的状态，当然很好。只是何必要一直隔空投掷原子弹，越过防线，把别人的领地炸得稀碎。那样对自己有什么好处，留下一个赤身裸体、两手空空的自己，和一无所有的弹药库。没有什么能够保护自己的了，似乎从来也不需要保护，像一颗牡蛎渐渐失去壳，也不再害怕失去，因为自己正生活在一片无限宽旷、平静、温和的海域。

It is not that gentle people are struck by pain, but rather that they actively choose pain, destined to bear the weight of a painful love with their very lives. I once said, "The enemy of 'best' is often the 'good enough.'" For me, that is also a fortunate realization—the unbearable nature of "good enough" is only apparent when one has seen what is truly "best." Not everyone gets to experience the life they long for, one filled with constant moments of pain. But precisely because this is what he desire and actively choose, he should feel happy.

不是温柔的人被痛苦砸中，而是他们主动选择了痛苦，注定要用生命的份量去承担起一份痛苦的爱。我曾经说，“最好”的敌人往往是“不错”，于自己而言，那也是一句幸运的感慨，“不错”之难以忍受是以看见了“最好”为前提的。并不是每一个人都能体验到他所期待的“时时都有痛感”的生活，正因为这是他所期待和主动选择的，那么，他应感到幸福。

There is one thing I am absolutely certain of at this moment: I should never deliberately ask foolish questions again, especially when I already know the answer in my heart. Willfully denying what we see clearly may not be self-deception, but in the end, it is nothing more than naive mischief. Of course, I have the right to be sentimental, just as the other person has the right not to respond. But I shouldn’t do that anymore. It may seem like an expression of love, but in reality, it only creates new pain. 

Today, as I stepped out the door, one thought filled my mind—I will grow, and what I long for is true maturity.

有一件我此刻非常确定的事，那就是以后都不应该故意问一些愚蠢的问题。尤其是在心里有答案的时候。故意否认那些我们看得清楚的东西，也许不算自欺，但它们终究是天真的捣蛋。当然，自己有抒情的权利，对方也有不回应的权利。可是，不应该再那样做了，它看起来是在表达爱，实际上呢，却是在制造新的痛苦。
今天，当自己走出门的时候，脑子里想到的是——我会成长，**我所渴望的，是真正的成熟**。

In the process of gradually maturing, will the attachment in my eyes fade away? 
Let’s wait and see.

出门听《The way to you》

When I think and express myself in another language, I feel a certain sense of freedom.

English has always been an easier language for me—concise and precise. While，Chinese feels more complex; it is simple in form yet rich in meaning, both precise and ambiguous at the same time.

一个人在雨里走走停停两小时，原本期盼着可以放空脑袋。适得其反。淋湿透的感觉也还好，不狼狈。

好想睡觉，可以安心睡八小时的那种。又是空想。

There is a lyric in Anpu’s song *Lives* that I really like: "I love you, you are a world."
Today, as I listened to it in the rain, a new perspective suddenly came to me—if I am loved by someone, that means I am a world to them. 

That realization was significant. I have always focused more on the ones I love, never truly seeing myself as a unique existence. 

When you love someone, they become ‘the one’. But looking at it from another angle, the one who loves is also an interesting world in themselves.

This moment will mark a beginning—the arrival of true equality.

I think I may finally understand something I once heard: “If you have something to say, it’s best to speak to a larger world rather than just to a specific person.” And with that, I also understand why, when someone wants to express or convey something, they would rather let those emotions and realizations exist in the public domain rather than respond privately.
The key difference between these two forms of expression lies in openness versus confinement. Public expression invites multiple interpretations—it’s not so much about being heard or understood, but simply about expressing the part of oneself that one chooses to share. It is for oneself, not for the other person, and it seeks no validation or understanding.
On the other hand, speaking directly to someone inherently limits both expression and interpretation. It prevents expression from becoming open and inclusive because it seeks understanding and response—like playing table tennis, hoping the other person will catch the ball and hit it back. But what if they don’t want to? What if they catch it but don’t want to return it? What would they have to do to meet such expectations? that is really stressful.

我想也许大概明白了之前听到的“如果你要说什么，最好是面向一个更大的世界，而不是只对着具体的某一个人。”从而也明白了为什么当对方要表达或者表明什么，他宁愿让这样的心情和感悟出现在公域，也不会私下回应。两种表达的差别在于开放和封闭。公开的表达会带来更多的解读，毋宁说他并不在意是否被听见或者理解，他只是表达了自己愿意表达出来的那部分。是为自己，不为对方，不求理解。但是对着某个人说话，事先就限制了表达和理解，它无法让表达成为更开放和包容的存在，**它企图得到理解和回应** ，就像打乒乓球，渴望对方能接到这个球再打回来。万一对方不想接呢？万一对方接了但不想打回来呢，对方要如何做才能满足自己的期待呢。它带来了压力。

I almost instinctively wanted to blame myself—what have I been doing these past few years? Why have I made no real progress? Those rare moments when my way of thinking was completely shattered have been so few and far between. Maybe I’ve stayed in my comfort zone for too long, and over time, that breeds a certain arrogance. On the surface, I might pretend to be “more tolerant” or “more worldly,” but in reality, I’ve just been circling around the same old world—the world of my own thoughts. There’s nothing truly new, no one uniquely special enough to challenge me. Everything feels a bit dull, which, naturally, is also proof of my growing cynicism.

Yet I’m almost certain—both of us are special enough. Otherwise, how else could I explain this strange “connection” that refuses to break? At least for me, The one is the most special one. And, if I’m honest, this sense of uniqueness will probably last for many years—unless one possibility unfolds: our thoughts and habits gradually become indistinguishable. Where that would lead, I have no idea.

Still, perhaps simply realizing that I haven’t truly grown is, in itself, a kind of growth.I really hope that one day, I won’t just fully understand but also be able to challenge him. A real challenge—not just stirring things up with a bunch of emotional words on purpose. 

本想习惯性责备自己这几年到底在干嘛，为什么毫无长进，那种真正意义上思维方式被彻底打破的时刻非常非常少，也许是在舒适区停留太久，时间长了人也会变得傲慢。虽然表面上还要伪装成“更宽容”、“见了更多世面”……但它们基本都是在原来的世界里打转，我说的是思维的世界。

没有新东西，没有对我来说足够特别的新的人出现，一切都有点无趣，自然这也是日渐刻薄的明证。

我几乎可以确定，自己和对方都是足够特别的。否则要怎么解释这种神奇的“关系”就是断裂不了。至少对我而言，他是最特别的一个。而且恐怕这种特殊性要维持很多年。除非，有一种可能——思维和习惯无限趋同。而它会导向什么结局，我不得而知。

无论如何，能意识到自己没什么成长也许本身就是一种成长。非常希望自己有一天不只是能完全的理解，还有能挑战对方的时候。是真正的挑战，不是故意写一堆抒情的捣乱。

我的脑子啊脑子啊它终于能正确地转动起来了。非常好，那它也是应该符合逻辑地停止运转一会了。
