“我可以跟在你身后，像影子追着光梦游。我可以等在这路口，不管你会不会经过。“（音乐《追光者》）

"Cath, no matter where you go, **I forever after**."（影片《Wuthering Heights》）

电影的结尾，是小时候的Cath和Heath躺在马棚阁楼上的那一晚，Heath因为Cath挨打，Cath偷偷跑去找他，看着他背后的伤痕不知道可以做什么。

-Heath，what can I do?  
-Just stay with me.

Heath需要的只是陪伴，是不离开。这是他的自尊心决定的。他从一开始就不接受怜悯和同情，更不接受奉献。他只需要一个不离开的伙伴，持续交手，越来越相像，直到这个伙伴成长为势均力敌的的精神爱人。“不离开”并非依赖，而是“**始终承认对方的存在**”。他们的爱情诞生于此，唏嘘的是，他们的生命也终结于此。

Heath和Cath的爱从诞生起就是平等的，人格始终平等，这实在是罕见的爱情书写。可以想像自卑纳言的作家Emily·Bruntë毕生对一种真正平等的灵魂爱情的渴望，这一份爱情始终无关于所谓阶级、身份、道德的跨越，它只关乎“人性”。横亘在Cath和Heath之间最高的山是二人相同的倔强，**两个“一模一样”的灵魂，在对抗和拉扯之间体验爱。Heath和Cath的爱情强度平等，他们势均力敌，但缺乏调节能力。** 

“阴魂不散的爱人”在影片中被处理成大量的“偷情”镜头，这是失败的。尽管它合乎成年人的欲望，但二人的羁绊并不在于身体的吸引和渴望，不在婚内的持续偷欢……真正令人心碎的情感深度在于灵魂始终选择等待和跟随。**它本来就是一个“守护”的故事，尽管看起来并没有岁月静好的安稳感，因为二人以不断离开彼此的方式，以背离自己内心的方式，反证“灵魂始终相守”的固执**。用身体欲望替代存在执念暴露了编剧和导演的审美水平。小说或者影片的力量不在于肉体张力，而在于贯穿始终的自我同一性执念。

Heath在高地荒原上等待Cath的长镜头并不多，每一个白天，每一个傍晚，他坐在相同的地方等待Cath。影片后半部分，他“写”给Cath的信没有得到回复，一次也没有，因为Cath一封也没读到，他怀抱着怎样的无望的希望继续选择等待，而一个脆弱的人类经不起痛苦的等待的折磨，这等待短暂结束于Cath死在绝望的等待以后。大胆猜测，Cath死去，她的灵魂还在Heath的周边，Heath可以和她的灵魂互相守护，直到Cath在心碎中死去……生与死无法将他们分开。“等待”关乎的命题其实只有一个——时间，而导演是不善于处理“时间”的。影片像儿童讲故事一样随意地换镜头，春夏秋冬，五年过去了。而等待的细节，属于人物本身的日常失神的时刻，孤独的安静的绝望的“等待”的细节……全都没有呈现。如果说浪漫来自某种反差，而电影更多呈现了高峰，“低谷/深潭”的部分太少，这使得情节dramatic到有些轻浮，并不深刻。太多的音乐渲染，摄影上刻意追求的“史诗”效果，美术设计上又过于浮夸/粗糙，拼凑起来，变成浮于表面的“惊心动魄”，感人至深的“深刻”始终没有显现出来。

《呼啸山庄》的核心命题是“人性”，Cath和Heath的爱情，其核心依然是“人性”，“人性”是使这部小说在漫长的接受史里获得比《简·爱》更长久生命力的根本原因。因为“人性”是超时空的。雄心勃勃的导演，要拍出史诗般的爱情，她要呈现的本应是“人性”，而不是“浪漫”。但她有意将浪漫置于人性之上，这是影片最大的问题。作为观众，有点遗憾。

Heath和Cath的灵魂完全一样，除了倔强，还有不服输和“坏”。这使我想到现实中的一些巧合，我时常觉得一个人的时而冷酷时而温柔是一种“贱”，在被认为已经消失的时候又跳出来使坏地露出一些存在感。而我自己其实是同样的“贱兮兮”，有太多出其不意的故意的动作，从前我说这是在“刷存在感”，这策略至少在七年前就开始使用。**同一类人不需要追问动作里包含什么，只需要知道故意发出“动作”意味着什么即可**。这“阴魂不散”的存在感就是影片中故意放在对方床单下的鸡蛋，是专属于Cath和Heath的默契。**一开始，无法预判的存在/行动都是“原来你和我一样坏”的惊奇，而后，种种无法预判的动作又成为意料之中，它终于变成专属的默契，持续存在的共谋结构。** 那就是，我痛得受不了了，你不要太得意，我要在你得意的时候冒出来告诉你，我一直痛着，因为你而痛着，所以我要趁你不注意的时候故意丢几个原子弹过来将你的“平安领空”整个炸掉，不要轻易忘了我，因为我还没有忘掉你。在影片中，就是那突然出现的石头，正正砸中那扇窗。它简直有点像2010年看过的法国电影《两小无猜》。命中注定的爱人，结局不会好，他们的爱情和整个的人生都会毁灭于此，毁灭于专属的默契。

**不要太相信和依赖“默契”**。“镜像”爱人原本就是永远无法弄丢的，但停留在“镜像”本身一定是悲剧。《呼啸山庄》的悲剧不仅仅是Heath对Cath说出“You betrayed your heart”那么简单，不止是他们随意地和不在心里的人结婚又持续分心那么简单，悲剧在于整个故事始终停留在“爱情”层面，过于经典的水仙之爱。被困在镜像爱情里的两个人除了无尽的折磨而又无法挣脱，除了体验这种痛苦，还能得到什么？假使所有外界的阻碍不存在，“在一起”会怎样？大概又是花束般的恋爱，或者变成“结了婚生了孩子以后”的家庭伦理剧。**镜像爱情依赖张力，失去张力，它会崩塌**。

和世界上“另一个我”相遇、相知、相爱的故事，结局到底应该怎么安放？小说家从一开始就要写一个悲剧，电影导演尽力回避悲剧的延续，只呈现Catherine和Heathcliff之间“禁忌之恋”的戏剧张力。它是人间可能存在的爱情吗？如果真的存在，谁可以给它一个好的结局？简·爱获得了主体的成长最终因为“救赎”收获“可能的幸福”，因为她一直在往前走，从一个环境走到另一个环境。而凯瑟琳永远被爱囚禁在呼啸山庄和吉屯田庄，她走不出那片荒原。Emily·Bruntë从一开始就不给Cathrine活路的，她走不出父权的家庭，走不出绝望的爱情，走不出生命的荒原……尽管如此，她收获了罕见的爱，她的一生也只有这一份爱，她在乎并为之死去的，还是这一份爱。爱真有如此强大的力量？

2026年了，还有人信仰“真爱”吗？现代理论家和批评家们已反复解构过“爱”这个字眼，“爱”还能是什么？“爱”还能如何存在？“爱”还可以教人做什么？走到哪里去？我的答案已经写在昨天的Journal里。

I Forever After

>“I could follow behind you, like a shadow chasing light in a sleepwalk. I could wait at this crossing, whether or not you pass by.” (Song: Chasing the Light)

>“Cath, no matter where you go, I forever after.” (Wuthering Heights)

At the end of the film, it returns to that childhood night when Cath and Heath lay in the loft of the stable. Heath has been beaten because of Cath. She sneaks out to find him. Looking at the wounds on his back, she does not know what she can possibly do.

>— Heath, what can I do?  
— Just stay with me.

What Heath needs is only companionship — not leaving. This is determined by his pride. From the beginning he refuses pity and sympathy, even more so any form of sacrifice. What he wants is simply a partner who does not leave, who continues to cross swords with him, becoming more and more alike, until that partner grows into an equal spiritual lover. “Not leaving” is not dependence; it is the continual acknowledgment of the other’s existence. Their love is born here. Tragically, their lives also end here.

The love between Heath and Cath is equal from the moment it is born. Their personalities are always equal. That is rare in the writing of love. One can imagine the self-effacing, reticent writer, Emily Brontë, longing throughout her life for a truly equal love between souls. This love has nothing to do with class, status, or moral transgression. It concerns only “human nature.” The highest mountain standing between Cath and Heath is their identical stubbornness — two souls exactly the same, experiencing love through confrontation and tension. Their intensity is equal. They are evenly matched. But they lack the ability to regulate.

The “haunting lover” in the film is rendered through repeated scenes of adultery. This is a failure. It may align with adult desire, but their bond is not rooted in bodily attraction or illicit pleasure. The true heartbreak lies in the soul’s persistent choice to wait and to follow. At its core, this is a story about guarding — even though it appears anything but peaceful, because they constantly leave each other, constantly betray their own hearts, as if to prove through negation that their souls remain inseparable. To replace existential obsession with physical desire exposes the aesthetic limitation of the screenwriter and director. The power of the novel — or the film — does not lie in erotic tension but in the obsessive insistence on self-identity that runs through it.

There are not many long shots of Heath waiting on the moor. Every day, every dusk, he sits in the same place waiting for Cath. In the latter half of the film, he “writes” letters to her that never receive a reply — not once — because she never reads them. With what hopeless hope does he continue to wait? A fragile human cannot endure the torment of waiting forever. That waiting ends briefly only because Cath dies in her own despairing wait. One might dare to imagine that after her death, her soul lingers near Heath, that they guard one another in spirit until she herself breaks in heart. Life and death cannot separate them.

Waiting ultimately concerns only one question: time. And the director is not skilled in handling time. The film shifts scenes like a child telling a story — spring, summer, autumn, winter, five years gone. But the details of waiting — the daily absent-mindedness, the silent loneliness, the quiet despair — are never shown. Romance comes from contrast, yet the film presents mostly the peaks. The valleys, the depths, are too few. As a result, the drama becomes almost frivolous. Excessive music, an overly self-conscious pursuit of “epic” cinematography, art design that feels at once extravagant and rough — stitched together, they produce a surface-level “heart-stopping” spectacle, but never true depth.

The core proposition of Wuthering Heights is “human nature.” The love between Cath and Heath is also, at its core, about human nature. That is why this novel has had a longer life in reception history than Jane Eyre. Because human nature transcends time. An ambitious director who seeks to create an epic love story should have centered human nature, not romance. To elevate romance above human nature is the film’s greatest flaw. As a viewer, one cannot help but feel regret.

Heath and Cath’s souls are identical — stubborn, unwilling to yield, and “bad.” This makes me think of certain coincidences in real life. I often feel that a person’s alternation between coldness and tenderness is a kind of meanness — disappearing when assumed gone, then reappearing mischievously to assert presence. But I myself am equally “mean,” full of unexpected, deliberate gestures. Years ago I called this “brushing up my sense of existence.” That strategy began at least seven years ago. People of the same kind do not need to interrogate the content of these gestures; it is enough to know that a deliberate gesture has been made.

This “haunting” sense of presence is like the egg deliberately placed under the other’s bedsheet in the film — a secret code unique to Cath and Heath. At first, the unpredictable action is the thrill of “so you are just as bad as I am.” Later, the unpredictable becomes expected. It turns into exclusive tacit understanding, an ongoing conspiracy structure. It says: I am in unbearable pain. Do not be too triumphant. When you think you are safe, I will reappear and remind you that I am still hurting — because of you. So I will throw a few atomic bombs into your peaceful airspace when you are not paying attention. Do not forget me so easily. I have not forgotten you. In the film, it is the sudden stone that shatters the window. It almost resembles Love Me If You Dare. Destined lovers rarely end well. Their love — and their entire lives — are destroyed by that exclusive complicity.

Do not place too much faith in “tacit understanding.” A mirror-lover can never truly be lost, but remaining trapped in mirroring is tragedy. The tragedy of Wuthering Heights is not simply that Heath says, “You betrayed your heart.” It is not merely that they marry those they do not love and remain emotionally divided. The tragedy is that the entire story never moves beyond the level of love — a classic Narcissus-like devotion. Two people trapped in mirror-love gain nothing but endless torment. Suppose all external obstacles vanished. What then? Perhaps a bouquet-like romance. Or a domestic drama after marriage and children. Mirror-love depends on tension. Remove the tension, and it collapses.

If one encounters, knows, and loves “another self” in this world, how should the ending be arranged? The novelist intends tragedy from the beginning. The director attempts to soften its continuation, focusing only on the dramatic tension of forbidden love. Is such love possible in the real world? If it is, who can grant it a good ending?

Jane Eyre achieves subjecthood and receives a possible happiness through redemption because she keeps moving forward, from one environment to another. Catherine remains imprisoned by love within Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. She never leaves the moor. Emily Brontë never grants Catherine an exit. She cannot escape patriarchy, cannot escape despairing love, cannot escape the wasteland of life. And yet she receives a rare love — the only love of her life — and what she cares for and dies for is still that love.

Is love truly that powerful?

It is 2026. Does anyone still believe in “true love”? Modern theorists and critics have deconstructed the word again and again. What can “love” still mean? How can it still exist? What can it teach a person to do? Where can it lead?

My answer was already written in yesterday’s journal.
