《没有烟抽的日子》，最初听到的是张悬的翻唱，后来就是雨生的原唱。

昨夜睡得非常不好，与人争吵，哭喊声数次穿过梦的界限，来到现实。我是在做梦的，并不知道身边的人是否听见我的哭喊。醒来再看，现实当然没有梦境那么糟糕，自己也不是什么被辜负的“受害者”，我和他们是遥远的。我，是平安的。

醒来在网络上找到视频，先听雨生唱，又听了张悬的版本。我觉得“抱着酒瓶，点一根烟上台唱歌”的她似乎更接近歌本身。有一丝丝几近于无的惆怅，也许更接近无奈。作词人的、谱曲者的、演唱者的、自己此刻的无奈……全都不同。

三十六年过去了，所有与这首歌相关的人都获得了各个的平安，写诗的少年已长大，成为看上去和过去完全不同的“人物”，谱曲和演唱的的雨生很早就离开了这个世界，还在翻唱它的安溥、青峰、阿妹也都不再是从前的模样。听歌的自己，也再难拾起2012年秋天的心境。

时间悄悄改变万物的模样，包括那份无奈的心情，对别人的，对自己的，对历史的，对世界的。当少年人拥有不属于自己年龄的沧桑感，他们创作出这首歌，唱起这首歌，聆听这首歌。
我想，无论多少年过去，他们全都不会承认自己曾看错。  

唯有无奈。

I first heard The Days Without Cigarettes in Deserts Chang’s cover version. Later, I found Tom Chang’s original.  

I slept poorly last night. After a heated argument, the echoes of shouting pierced the boundaries of my dreams again and again, slipping into reality. I was dreaming, and didn’t know whether the people around me had heard my cries. When I awoke, the world was, of course, not as bleak as it had been in the dream. I wasn't some betrayed "victim"—I was simply distant from them. And I was safe.  

I went online and found the video—first listening to Tom Chang's version, then to Deserts'. I felt that her version—holding a bottle of alcohol, lighting a cigarette on stage—somehow resonated more deeply with the song itself. A threadbare melancholy, scarcely perceptible, but perhaps closer to resignation. The resignation of the lyricist, the composer, the singer, and my own—each one different.  

Thirty-six years have passed. Everyone once tied to this song has found their own kind of peace. The young poet has grown up, becoming someone who outwardly bears no resemblance to the past. Tom Chang, who composed and sang it, left this world far too early. Those who still cover the song—Deserts Chang, Wu Qing-Feng, A-Mei—are no longer who they once were. And I, the listener, can no longer summon the state of mind I had in the autumn of 2012.  

Time quietly reshapes everything, even the feeling of helplessness—toward others, toward oneself, toward history, toward the world. When the young carry the weight of sorrow beyond their years, they write songs like this, sing them, and listen to them.  

I think, no matter how many years pass, none of them would ever admit they were wrong about something.   

All that remains is resignation.  

*If there are no cigarettes in hand, then strike a match.  
Smoke your helplessness.  
Smoke that single strand of rain that will never return.*

微博英译中无比的烂，甚至不如ChatGPT的英译中。中文原版修改了十几遍，放在不同平台，结果是全部删除。只是一段晨间的心情，依然不允许存在。在这片“纯洁”的土地，到底还有什么是允许存在的。昨夜的无奈，听歌的无奈，此刻的无奈……唯有无奈。那就到这里吧。

此刻感到一些遗憾，很早以前曾有那么大的精神世界、那样纯粹的理想，从来不听后来常常听的那些抒情意味浓厚的歌。可是在过去六年，纵身跳入另一个人的世界，自己的世界突然变得那样小，小到差一点失去了自己。大家从根本上就是完全不同的人，自己没有能力也不应该介入别人的命运。爱不应该是这样。尽管自己依然不愿承认从一开始错看了谁，所有许过的愿、说过的话、做过的梦……它们全部都值得。也许还有一点点无奈，完完全全没有别的遗憾了。
